# My_sokoban_Tek1

Epitech project

Language: C

My favorite game project without graphics. 

The goal of this project is to develop a copy of Sokoban game in terminal mode, using the ncurses library.

# **REQUIREMENTS**

* GCC
* Make
* NCURSES library

To test it you have map1.txt map2.txt and map3.txt.

# **USAGES** *(you have to be in the root floder)*

- Compilation :
$>  make

- Execution :
$>  ./my_sokoban map1.txt

- Help :
$>  ./my_sokoban -h

# **GAMEPLAY**
+ Use arrows to move P.
+ Press SPACE BAR to reset.
+ Put the X (boxes) on the O (storage locations).
+ If all the boxes are on the storage locations, you win.
+ If none of the boxes can be moved anymore, you lose.
+ To exit press escape.
